# LevelTweaks
Modify the NJS and Offset for Beat Saber maps and save configurations in different profiles.

## How To Use
Navigate to the gameplay modifiers tab and select a non OST level. Hit the New button to create a new tweak and modify the values. Setting NJS to anything other then the default **will disable score submission**! Make sure to select back to the default profile in order to disable Level Tweaks for that specific level.
